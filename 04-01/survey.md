## 1. Which of the following topics are you *most* interested in?
- Programming using Python and Cython (a fast Python compiler)
- Algorithms for linear algebra over finite fields
- Symbolic calculus
- Numerical linear algebra
- Computational number theory
- Sharing mathematics over the web (e.g., interactive pages, 3d graphics in web pages)
- Statistics using numpy and R
- Revision control and collaboration tools
- Abstract algebra (groups, rings, and fields)
- Graph theory (vertices, edges, networks)
- Public-key cryptography
- Hidden Markov Models
- Typesetting mathematical documents using LaTeX (both PDF and in web pages).
- Other: __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

## 2. Estimate the number of lines of code you've written in each of these programming languages (0, 1000, or 100000?)
- Java
- Javascript (or CoffeeScript)
- Python
- C/C++/C#/Object-C
- Matlab
- Fortran
- Other: ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

## 3. Estimate how long you think it would take you to solve each of the following problems (imagine they are homework problems)

In many cases the solution is a single line of code in Sage or another program, but finding that line is difficult.  Part of the question I'm asking is also how long you guess that line would take to run.  Another part of the question is whether you understand the question.

- Find the sum of the integers up to a million.
- Write a 2-page paper in LaTeX explaining the definition of derivative of a function in Calculus.
- Write a function in Python that takes as input a function and interval and numerically estimates the integral of the function over that interval.
- Factor this particular 50-digit integer: 54334559688831933144970780034494033148425334985257
- Compute the mean and standard deviation of a list of ten million numbers available online.
- Evaluate the Riemann zeta function to 30 digits of precision at the point 2+I.
- Compute the determinant of a 500x500 matrix of integers, randomly chosen to be either 0 or 1.
- Implement from scratch an algorithm to compute  ____________________________ (make up something you care about!).
