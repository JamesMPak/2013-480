This is a course about how to use open source mathematical software (mainly Sage http://sagemath.org).   The course will start with a fairly quick introduction to programming with Python, then cover computational approaches to symbolic calculus, linear algebra, basic combinatorics, elementary number theory, and introductory statistics.     This course will be taught jointly as a graduate and undergraduate course -- there will be homework problems for graduate students that require substantially more mathematical maturity, along with certain parts of lectures being aimed at them.  All students will do a final project that involves programming.  

Prerequisites: Students must have taken a Calculus course and a Linear Algebra course, and should have taken *some* (any) course that involved computer programming (the language doesn't matter).
